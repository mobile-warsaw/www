  name: Robert Abramczyk
  description: I'm a WUT's Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science graduate in AI specialization. Passionate about the human brain, science, and philosophy. I started as the only iOS developer in Inteliclinic, working on the intelligent sleep mask Neuroon. I've been in love with mobile development and IoT ever since. Currently on a verge of an affair with functional programming. I especially enjoy a good TED talk, lone walks and playing some instruments.
