  description: I called myself Digital Indiana because for most of the time I feel like a digital Indiana Jones. From time to time I squash some bugs (in code) and I try to avoid traps (by testing). Overcoming challenges is what drives me. So far, 6 years in iOS development. Iâ€™ve got a huge passion to travel.
