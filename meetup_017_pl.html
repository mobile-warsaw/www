  description: "Staś Małolepszy calls his role at Mozilla 'localizabilizer', a self-appointed job title meant to emphasize the importance of making software localizable in today's world. Once a translator himself, he now works with hundreds of volunteers around the globe — an open-source community, which continues to deliver top-quality localization of Firefox in nearly 100 locales to over 400 million users worldwide. Staś' current focus is Firefox OS and L20n, a new paradigm-shifting localization platform and programming language from Mozilla."
