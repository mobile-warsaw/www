  description: "Wojtek is Head of Engineering at Polidea - mobile/hardware software-house. That’s an unusual environment for a backend dev - here it’s the mobile app, that is the center of universe. Backend is the one that has to fit best, so that the app remains simple and robust. Thanks to that he has gathered many interesting tips and tricks, that he will gladly share.</br></bri>Wojtek invented MobileWarsaw, GitKata and Mobile Central Europe. He’s also co-leader of Warsaw JUG and Warsjawa conference. Worked on Apphance Flow - an OS build tool for mobile and co-created a library for unit testing Android apps - RoboSpock."
